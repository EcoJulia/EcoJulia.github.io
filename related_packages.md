# Related Packages

The Julia packages listed below are within the broader discipline of ecology, but not expressly built on top of `EcoBase.jl`.

## Circuitscape.jl & Omniscape.jl
Model connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes

## DynamicGrids.jl
A generalized framework for building high-performance grid-based spatial simulations, including cellular automata, and behaviours like random jumps and interactions between multiple grids.

## Dispersal.jl
Extends DynamicGrids.jl for grid-based simulations of organism dispersal.

## EcologicalNetworks.jl
Common interface to analyze all types of data on ecological networks including bipartite/unipartite as well as deterministic/quantitative/probabilistic networks.

## GrowthMaps.jl
[GrowthMaps.jl](https://github.com/cesaraustralia/GrowthMaps.jl) efficiently generates the layers required for growth rules based on temperature response and stress factors. Interoperability with Dispersal.jl and DynamicGrids.jl.

# Mangal.jl
API for the [mangal](https://mangal.io/#/) ecological interactions database
